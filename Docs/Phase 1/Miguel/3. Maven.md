> Nov 1, 2020

*Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.*

In a first sight my impresion of Maven is that it's like **npm**, I used it some days more and then I could probe it more on making projects and I get that It's more tha a simple administrator of dependencies. Maven is a tool that works in general to the **project management of Java projects** alowing us to manage dependencies, compiling and packaging.

**Maven** solves a lot of problems in packaging and with some lines of terminal it generates us a project structure. Here's some documentation that can help you:
