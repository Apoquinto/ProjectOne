# 6. The POM.xml

> Nov 7, 2020

*A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.*

So, here it is. The central file of all the Maven workflow. **The POM.xml** file contains all information about dependencies, sub-dependencies and packages we have. It also has the version, the *groupId* and also the *name of the project*.

*Dependency management is a core feature of Maven. Managing dependencies for a single project is easy. Managing dependencies for multi-module projects and applications that consist of hundreds of modules is possible. Maven helps a great deal in defining, creating, and maintaining reproducible builds with well-defined classpaths and library versions.*

Maven also helps us to handle dependencies that come from [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) and it also helps us into how to use them. Now you don't need to download the jar files of each dependency and manage them to work on the system you're. 

And here's how you add a dependency to the project:

```xml
    <project>
      ...
      <dependencies>

        <!-- Here you add the dependency  -->
        <dependency>
          <groupId>group-a</groupId>
          <artifactId>artifact-a</artifactId>
          <version>1.0</version>
          <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
              <groupId>group-c</groupId>
              <artifactId>excluded-artifact</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
          </exclusions>
        </dependency>


        <dependency>
          <groupId>group-a</groupId>
          <artifactId>artifact-b</artifactId>
          <version>1.0</version>
          <type>bar</type>
          <scope>runtime</scope>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </project>
```
