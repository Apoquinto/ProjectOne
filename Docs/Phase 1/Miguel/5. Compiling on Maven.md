# 5. Compiling Maven

> Nov 6, 2020

One of the advantages that Maven gives us is the posibility to **compile** and **packaging** our projects. We can use it with the command:

```sh
mvn compile
```
This will generate us a *target* folder where we will have our classes and compiled files of our project.

Now, if what we want is to get the executable file (*jar*) of the project, we will use the command:

```sh
mvn package
```
This will package our project and will generate the compiled file. Now we can clean our target folder using the next command:

```sh
mvn clean
```
