# 4. Using Maven

> Nov 5, 2020

The principal command that Maven uses is **mvn** which is the base of all of others. One of the most important *flags* you can use is the **project creation** one:
 
```sh
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app 
```

Where **archetype:generate** indicates that we're generating a new project. **-DgroupId=com.mycompany.app**  defines the structure that your project follows (and what's the difference with the others) while the **-DartifactId=my-app** flag generates the name of our compiled.

This command lets us to choose in an interactive way. It'll ask us some specifications of our project, just as the version, the author and the type of dependencies. And adding the next flag we will be able to unable this interactions and Maven will asume them by default:

```sh
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app  -DinteractiveMode=false
```
And finally other of the important parameters we must consider is the **-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart** which indicates the kind of application we'll generate. If we would want to generate a strucutre for a *WebApp* we use:

```sh
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp  -DinteractiveMode=false
```
