*Devops integrantes developers and operation teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infraestructure, automating workflows and continuously measuring application performance*

**Devops** is not only a person or a role on a company. It's a **mindset**, a way to take and create a culture in the theme using automatic tests, deployments, etc on process of CI/CD. A devops  measures te productivity of the fixes, the request time to the product and the time of fixing operation issues.

**Mayor deployments, menos erroes = success**

One of the videos that helped me a lot to understand the concept of devops is: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I94-tJlovg).

One of the most importants points (as competitive and internally) is the time reudction to release products to market. This along with the focus on the product and the commerce in general.

**New tools** are neccesary on a devops oriented team. One of them is *Jenkins*, also a tool that can manage the source code (as *Github*), which wil allow us to manage and document all the changes to the code. Also we'll need a tool to make deployment of projects.

Devops is a **philosophy** of development that allows us to innovate in a fast way, and a better facing the necesities of the buisness.
