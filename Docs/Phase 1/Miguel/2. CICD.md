# 1. CI / CD

> Oct 28, 2020

*Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (Continuous Deployment?)*

**Continuous Integration** or CI refers to the automatic practices that we use to integrate the **source code** of different colaborators in the project. We normally build an image of docker, compile and build the code. And this phase makes focus into know if the code is clean and can passs some tests and doesn't break the project. 

Now, CD has two different points of view Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment. Some people call it Continuous Distribuition too. It automatically releases to the repository (Merging and making the image or the binary)
